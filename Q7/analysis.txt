1. Ease to develop
Python: Easy, since matplotlib, for example, has builtin functions to create a
wide variety of visualizations.
Tableau: Extremely easy, as it offers “plug and play” components with dragging and drop menus.
D3: Harder since you have to build most visualizations from scratch.

2. Ease to maintain the visualization
Python: Easy, since it can run in different machines and code can be dataset-agnostic.
Tableau: Slightly harder, since it’s not so simple to acquire the software to the host machine.
D3: Hard, since different versions change several function signatures.

3. Usability of visualization
Python: Difficult, user must know how to run Python and make sure all dependencies are correct.
Tableau: Easy, as there’s no programming involved and user-friendly GUIs.
D3: Extremely easy, D3 provides a lot of interactivity and no programming required (from end-user)

4. Scalability of visualization
Python: offers integration with Hadoop
Tableau: also offers integration with Hadoop, but easier, since it provides GUIs
D3: not so scalable, as it was built for visualization and interactivity and handle small datasets with a data-to-graphics binding model.

5. System requirements
Python: Python software and some packages (e.g. numpy, pandas, matplotlib). Freely available.
Tableau: Browser and internet connection OR the Tableau desktop software with licensing (or free trial hehe)
D3: Browser and internet connection.
